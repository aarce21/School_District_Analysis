# School_District_Analysis
# Overview  
The purpose of the School District Analysis is to gather various metrics on school data to deliver the results to a school board. With the focus on the math and reading scores from different schools, our goal was to see how the students performed, how schools ranked among each other, and determine a school's budget and budget per capita. When the School Board noticed dishonesty among the results of Thomas High School's 9th graders, our objective was then to re-run the analysis without those scors being accounted for and then see if they had a significant difference on the district summary as a whole.

After re-running the analysis, Thomas High School's overall passing percentage dropped from a 91% overall passing rate, as seen in the original photo above, to a 65% overall passing rate. When we dropped the 9th grade reading and math scores and only accounted for the 10th-12th grade scores, this caused the rest of the data to correct itself and the new number are based only off of those three grade levels.
